The sample code explains how to build a very simple chat application in Android using Parse backend-as-a-service.

Note: This chat application is by no means a fully-featured or production ready chat function. This tutorial is an illustration of how to quickly build an app using Parse.
Usage

In order to be able to run this app, clone it and update the applicationId, server and clientKey in ChatApplication.java file.

Parse.initialize(new Parse.Configuration.Builder(this)
             .applicationId("YOUR_APPLICATION_ID") // should correspond to APP_ID env variable
             .addNetworkInterceptor(new ParseLogInterceptor())
             .server("https://myparseapp.herokuapp.com/parse/")
             .clientKey("YOUR_CLIENT_KEY").build());
